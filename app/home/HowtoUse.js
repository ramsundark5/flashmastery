    <p><b><u>Flashcard Sets</b></u></p>
    <p><span>The home dashboard shows various colored tiles that are&ldquo;sets&rdquo; of flashcard decks. Each set contains several flashcard decks. A flashcard deck is a collection of flashcards. </span></p>
    <p><b>Flashcard Decks</b></p>
    <p><span>To practice a flashcard deck, click on a flashcard set from one of the colored tiles from the home dashboard. Next, click on the colored tile for the flashcard deck you want to practice. You&rsquo;ll see the following options: </span></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Practice All</b><span>: This will show you all of the flashcards in the deck. Always do this at least once before doing Adaptive Practice. </span>
        </li>
        <li><b>Adaptive Practice</b><span>: Only display the cards that have not been mastered. </span>
        </li>
        <li><b>View Report: </b><span>Shows the accuracy and total mastery for each item in the deck. The accuracy is calculated based on the ratio of number of times the user pressed &ldquo;learning&rdquo; and &ldquo;mastery&rdquo; while practicing flash cards. The total mastery of the deck (% at the top of report) is based on the number of items that have an accuracy at or above the minimum % threshold. </span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><u>Practicing Flashcards</b></u></p>
    <p><span>Once you start a practice session, you&rsquo;ll see your first flashcard. You&rsquo;ll have the following options: </span>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Learning or Mastery Buttons</b><span>: If the user quickly and correctly answers a flashcard, then press the &ldquo;mastered&rdquo; button. If the student does not know the item very well, press &ldquo;learning&rdquo;. After pressing the buttons, the next card will automatically be displayed. This process tracks data and allows for adaptive practice and useful data reports. </span></li>
        <li><b>Backside: </b><span>Some cards have text on the backside. Press anywhere on the card to flip over to show the backside of the card. If the card has no data on the backside, the card will not flip. </span></li>
        <li><b>Swipe: </b><span>The user can swipe through the cards without pressing &ldquo;mastered&rdquo; or &ldquo;learning&rdquo;. If you do this, no data will be recorded for the reports. </span></li>
        <li><b>Back</b><span>: Press &ldquo;back&rdquo; to exit the practice session if you want to exit before finishing the deck. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><b><u>Side Menu</b></u></p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Switch User: </b><span>You can switch among different users (or students) to track separate data for each user.</span></li>
        <li><b>Manage Users: </b><span>You can add new users or delete users. Swipe left to delete a user, and type in the name at the bottom of the screen and press &ldquo;add&rdquo; to add a new user. </span></li>
        <li><b>View Reports: </b><span>This report shows an overall summary of mastery from all decks and sets from the app. Each deck will have a percentage next to it, which indicates the % of items that are mastered on that particular deck. You can click on the deck from this report to view a more detailed deck report. </span></li>
        <li><b>Settings: </b><span>You can change the &ldquo;Mastery Accuracy Threshold&rdquo; for the app. For example, if you set it at 80%, the user would have to press the &ldquo;mastered&rdquo; button 80% of the time or more to have an item mastered. </span></li>
